# HPGLTest

This is a little program to draw a shuttle taking off using HPGL and my 7090A plotter.

It is based on the Imerpial Walker from https://github.com/spustlik/plotr and the shuttle image from https://autodesk.blogs.com/between_the_lines/2018/02/throwback-thursdayspace-shuttle-sample-drawings.html
